## Hi I'm MichelleðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a Computer Science and Quantitative Economics student at Smith College interested in how technology and business intersect to create real-world impact. My academic work and extracurricular experiences have built a foundation in analytical thinking, programming, and problem-solving. Through research using Python and R and leadership roles in student initiatives, Iâ€™ve developed an interest in product management, business strategy, and software engineering, where I can apply both technical and organizational skills to meaningful challenges.
